# app/operations.py

"""
Module: operations.py

This module contains basic arithmetic functions that perform addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division of two numbers. These functions are foundational for
building more complex applications, such as calculators or financial tools.

Functions:
- add(a: Union[int, float], b: Union[int, float]) -> Union[int, float]: Returns the sum of a and b.
- subtract(a: Union[int, float], b: Union[int, float]) -> Union[int, float]: Returns the difference when b is subtracted from a.
- multiply(a: Union[int, float], b: Union[int, float]) -> Union[int, float]: Returns the product of a and b.
- divide(a: Union[int, float], b: Union[int, float]) -> float: Returns the quotient when a is divided by b. Raises ValueError if b is zero.

Usage:
These functions can be imported and used in other modules or integrated into APIs
to perform arithmetic operations based on user input.

    """
    Add two numbers and return the result.

    Parameters:
    - a (int or float): The first number to add.
    - b (int or float): The second number to add.

    Returns:
    - int or float: The sum of a and b.

    Example:
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(2.5, 3)

def subtract(a: Number, b: Number) -> Number:
    """
    Subtract the second number from the first and return the result.

    Parameters:
    - a (int or float): The number from which to subtract.
    - b (int or float): The number to subtract.

    Returns:
    - int or float: The difference between a and b.

    Multiply two numbers and return the product.

    Parameters:
    - a (int or float): The first number to multiply.

    - int or float: The product of a and b.

    Returns:
    - float: The quotient of a divided by b.

    Raises:
    - ValueError: If b is zero, as division by zero is undefined.
